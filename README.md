(*Disclaimer: this program was made for study propose and has no responsibility to validate a real CNPJ. The program follows the validation logic of the CNPJ, however, is not considered a valid number by law.*)

In Brazil, the **National Register of the Legal Entity** (*meaning in English for the acronym CNPJ*) is a unique number that identifies a legal entity and other types of legal arrangement without legal personality with the Brazilian IRS.

# Who needs a CNPJ?

In addition to companies (regardless of size), the CNPJ is also mandatory to formalize:

Associations;
Non-governmental Organisations (Ngos);
Unions;
Churches;
political parties;
Condominiums;
investment funds; 
and among others.

Basically, any organization that receives money needs to be registered as a Legal Entity and have a CNPJ.

# How to validate a CNPJ?

Following a same line of reasoning for CPF validation, you will learn how to validate CNPJ. For know that the CNPJ is formed by at least fourteen numbers separated by several points, a bar and a dash, being as follows 12.345.678/0001-95.

The part that is before the bar means its registration number, and the value after the bar, and before the dash ends up representing a unique code for the matrix and the branch, the last two digits, which end up coming after the dash, are called check digits. These digits are formed from the first twelve numbers by the calculation you will see next.

Manually it is possible to perform this procedure, or even in a diversified programming and code form, to ensure all the confidence and validation of the document correctly and thus ensure the legitimacy of the company.
